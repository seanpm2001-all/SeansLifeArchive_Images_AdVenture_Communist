# November 14th 2020 session notes

These are the notes for my November 14th 2020 AdVenture Communist session

1. Some of the first pictures for today were from the beginning of the game, as it took me a little while to figure out how to sign in to the correct account (I thought I had to complete the full tutorial first) this is because I have recently switched from a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge to a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE.

2. The files for this session are labeled as 1080p, instead of 1440p. This is because my new phone has a resolution of 2000x1080/1080x2000 (a downgrade from 2560x1440/1440x2560) and I am having difficulty applying the correct name (1080p) this issue is very similar to the issue of writing the date 2019 for the first few weeks by accident repeatedly in the first month of 2020.

3. I was unable to view ads during gameplay today, due to my new phone having issues with ad playback and accepting in-game ad bonuses. I tried once, but it didn't work.

4. I didn't go to the event today, as I didn't have the time

5. The files are sorted into 2 sub-directories, instead of 6. I am having difficulty figuring out how to move files or create folders in Android 10, and the easiest way I could zip the files was to zip the top files (55) delete all other files, then zip the other 500

6. No other notes for the November 14th 2020 AdCom session

Those are all the session notes for today.
