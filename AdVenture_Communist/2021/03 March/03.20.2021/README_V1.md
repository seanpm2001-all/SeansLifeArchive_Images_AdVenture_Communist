# March 20th 2021 AdVenture Communist session

I had a very long session today and made lots of progress. I ranked up from rank 32 to rank 33, and played for over 4 hours. I had the ability to quit early on, but  I never got to it, as then there was more to do.

A lot of todays progress screenshots contain palindromes and similar number types that I don't know how to classify.

I eventually ended my session, but forgot to max my timer again.
